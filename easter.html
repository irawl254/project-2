          <h2>Easter Island</h2>
          <!-- I asked chatgpt "tell me about easter island" to get the paragraphs of information about the site-->
          <p>
            Easter Island, known as Rapa Nui by its native inhabitants, is a
            remote volcanic island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It is most
            famous for its nearly 1,000 massive stone statues called moai, which
            were carved by the Rapa Nui people between the 13th and 16th
            centuries. These statues, some towering over 30 feet and weighing
            several tons, are believed to represent ancestral figures and were
            placed on stone platforms called ahu.
          </p>

          <p>
            The island was first settled by Polynesians around 1200 AD. Over
            time, deforestation, resource depletion, and internal conflicts
            contributed to societal decline. European explorers arrived in the
            18th century, and the island was later annexed by Chile in 1888.
            Today, Easter Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting
            tourists and researchers fascinated by its rich history and
            mysterious past.
